title: Successful at Selection Workshop in Bonn
---

Our journey has started in the German Aerospace Center in Bonn on the 27 November 2017.  We were asked to present QUEST at the REXUS/BEXUS Selection Workshop in the department of Space Administration. The selection board seemed to be convinced and we are proud to announce that we got accepted. Our next step is the Preliminary Design Review in Kiruna (Northern Sweden).
