We went to Sweden. Our design was reviewed there by experts from ESA, SNSC, DLR and other organizations. They seemed to be satisfied so far. We are good in time and we donâ€™t have to improve our experiment that much. Besides the review we learned a lot from the expert and one week full of exciting lectures and activities about carrying an experiment to space. The vehicle in the title image will carry our experiment to the start location.
