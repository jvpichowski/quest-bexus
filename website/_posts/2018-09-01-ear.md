title: Experiment Acceptance Review at ZARM, Bremen
---

Our system engineer Peter St√∂ferle went together with our project manager [Jan von Pichowski](https://github.com/jvpichowski) to the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity in Bremen, Germany.
After passing some final tests in the vacuum chamber our experiment got accepted for the launch at Esrange Space Center. We are very happy to pass this final mark and prepare for a successful launch.
