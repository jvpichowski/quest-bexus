The REXUS/BEXUS programme is realised under a bilateral Agency Agreement between the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Swedish National Space Board (SNSB). The Swedish share of the payload has been made available to students from other European countries through the collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA).

## Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg

The University of Würzburg, namely the Chair of Aerospace Information Technology, supports us through Prof. Dr. Hakan Kayal and his team with their knowledge and experience in this field of research. Furthermore, they provide a wide spectrum of technical equipment to us. Additionally, to Kayal’s team we are supported by a mechanical advisor.

## uduino

Mr. Chadwick is the creator of the crowdfunded uduinos. We are very lucky that he has sponsored us some of them. They will be tested as possible housekeeping units in our system. It is very exiting to test crowdfunded technology in our experiement. A big thank you goes to Mr. Chadwick for developing the uduinos and sponsoring us.

## Mouser Electronics Inc, Texas Instruments Inc, Thorlabs

We are very happy about the support of Mouser, since we obtain many parts for our PCBs from them.

Our power converters are built with sponsored DC-Converters of Texas Instruments. We’re grateful for those reliable components.

Thorlabs does not only provide the needed filters. They also ensure with their snack boxes that we don’t go hungry while working.

## ZARGES, Leica Geosystems

To secure the transport of our experiment, we were sponsored with two ZARGES Boxes. The experiment fits perfectly in the Maxi Box which protects it very well.

Leica Geosystems AG helped us sending additional Team members to the Launch Campaign. The Launch would not be that successful without these members.
